# Identify any collisions. Explain why different strings can map to the same index and why a matching index does not prove two keys are equal.
# ANS: different keys can map to the same index bcos they have the same hash value when calculated with the hash function, a matching index doesnt prove two keys are equal bcos, two keys may have the same characters and mean the same thing, therfore having different values also
